Luckily, with [bug 1144778](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1144778) we introduced an HTTP `Date` header which tells us what time the client's clock thinks it is when it is sending the data. Coupled with the `Timestamp` field recorded which is what time the server's clock thinks it is when it receives the data, we can subtract the more egregious examples of clock skew and get values that are closer to reality."
